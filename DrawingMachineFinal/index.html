      <h3>Statement</h3>
     <p class="pink"> Continuing with the genre of <i>“quarantine art”</i> in this project, I decided to create a drawing machine where the user can draw a bouquet and send it to someone special. With the ongoing continuation of social distancing, many of us are unable to celebrate or comfort loved ones. However, with this drawing machine, one can draw a bouquet to send to a loved one virtually. No contact is required! I was inspired by looking at the colorful scribbles on old cards that I made as a kid for different occasions. These handmade-cards are much more personal and sentimental compared to premade cards. I wanted to recreate the same sentiment in this drawing machine, allowing the user to create a bouquet that reflects their emotions to the recipient. The flowers the user draws can last forever, unlike real flowers.
